        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to Rafiza’s Cake Shop, a small, at-home bakery proudly based in Dallas, Texas. We started in 2015 as a bakery for sweets and small cake orders for small-scale events, such as neighborhood block parties and local school parties. Now, we have served tiered cakes for weddings and graduations, and have clients coming in from all corners of the world, from Canada to Pakistan, putting in orders to celebrate their special occasions with our creations. From baby showers to birthdays, to weddings, we are honored to be a part of the celebration and what makes it so memorable.

        <h2>Our Present</h2>
        <p>
            We specialize in custom cakes for all occasions including baby showers, graduations, and anniversaries. We proudly cater to the needs of our community by offering halal-friendly baked goods, as well as accommodating gluten-free and other dietary-conscious needs upon request. In addition to cakes and cupcakes, we also offer a variety of Desi sweets, our most popular being Rasmalai, in order to add a traditional touch to your celebrations. At Rafiza’s Cake shop, we take desserts very seriously, which is why we make sure every cake is designed and planned in close collaboration with the customer to ensure their vision is brought to life.
